        <td>With this command you can set certain modifiers for the anti-spam protection that is used with your channel. 
            "settings" argument must contain 4 multipliers separated by space.
            <ul>
              <li>First modifier is an unsigned integer which defines the length (in characters) of a "long message".
                  Long messages are assigned extra penalty points when issued by the user.</li>
              <li>The second modifier is unsigned float value telling how much penalty points should be assigned
                  to normal messages issued by a user. Everytime user says something in the channel, he is assigned
                  this value.</li>
              <li>The third modifier is an unsigned float value telling how much extra penalty points should
                  be assigned for long messages (defined by the first modifier).</li>
              <li>The fourth modifier is an unsigned float
                  value telling how much extra penalty points should be assigned for "doubled" messages, that is if user
                  sends message that is same as his previous message, it will get assigned these extra penalty points.</li>
            </ul>

            Each second 1 penalty point is reduced from every user. If number of penalty points reaches
            5 points, user is automatically muted for 15 minutes. <br />

            Note that all float values should use dot (.) as a delimiter, although you can use whole numbers as well.
            This regex describes the exact format of settings string: <br />
            <b><pre>"^\d+ \d+ [0-9]*\.?[0-9]+ [0-9]*\.?[0-9]+ [0-9]*\.?[0-9]+$"</pre></b>

            !spamsettings 200 1 0.5 0.5 <br />

  <ul>
  <li>[] - optional parameters

  <li>{} - sentence (one or more words separated by spaces)
  </ul>

  <p>Notes:</p>
  <ul>
